                <p>I am an aspiring full stack developer who has a passion for learning and languages. This inspired me to major in Mandarin Chinese as an undergrad and start to learn coding after graduation. I like to say that I'm still pursuing language, but now I talk to machines in addition to people! I love video games, LARPing, fantasy, gymnastics, field hockey, and so much more! Check below to see some of the stuff I'm into and what I'm working on.</p>
